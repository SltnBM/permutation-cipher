# 🔐 Permutation Cipher
A simple Python script to encrypt and decrypt text using the **Permutation (Transposition) Cipher** method.
This script works by rearranging characters in fixed-size blocks based on a user-defined key (permutation).

## ✨ Features
- 🔑 User-defined permutation keys with validation (must be a permutation of `1..m`).
- 🎲 Option to generate a random permutation key.
- 📏 Automatic padding with `X` to fit block size.
- ⌨️ Interactive user input for plaintext, block size, and keys.
- 🔄 Supports encryption, decryption, and both modes in one run.

## ⚙️ Requirements
- 🐍 Python 3.x
- 📦 No external libraries required.
